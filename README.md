# Brainny test - Fullstack

![Captura de tela de 2021-10-27 00-49-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46490801/139087621-0f9bcebc-d00e-4b56-9fd2-80d0e95a09ca.png)

[Brainny test - Fullstack](https://github.com/) is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

## How it works

Brainny test - Fullstack is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Brainny test - Fullstack is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.

#### Client libraries

Our approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.
